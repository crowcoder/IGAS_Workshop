Now that you have completed development of the API, it is time to #RubDevOpsOnIt.
Make sure you have completed the prerequisites so you have an Azure DevOps organization ready to go, log into your DevOps account, then:

1. Create project
    * Name the project whatever you want.
    * Choose between public and private. It may be easier to receive assistance if you make it public. 
    * Click "Create project" to generate a project backed by a Git repository.
1. Once the project has been created, choose "Repos" to get your source code into Azure Git.
1. Choose "Import a repository option".
1. For the clone URL, enter https://github.com/crowcoder/IGAS_Workshop.git
1. When the import is complete you will see your new repository. This repo is a copy of the GitHub repo, the two are not linked. Changes to one will not affect changes to the other.
